## Prerequisites:
docker


## Instructions:
- To run the node without reverse proxy:
  - `docker-compose up -d`
- With reverse proxy
  - `docker-compose -f docker-compose-rproxy.yml up -d`
  - Reverse proxy can be used to enable https instead of current http protocol on port 6876.
  - For https (tls) you need to have the fullchain.pem and privkey.pem in /etc/cert/ dir of the host. 
These 2 files can be for example symbolic link to /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem and privkey.pem as they are generated by certbot.
    - Path and name of certificates can be adapted in docker-compose yml files on the left side operand


## Notes:
- The docker-compose runtime files are Docker Swarm ready. They can be used in a docker swarm without additional changes.

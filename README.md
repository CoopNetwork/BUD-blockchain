One of the following options must be chosen in order to use it:
1. Download the code from this repository, compile it on Linux and run it on Windows or Linux
2. Download the compiled node and run it on your Windows or Linux PC. Download link https://bud.thecoopnetwork.io/bud-node-standalone.zip or https://blockchain.thecoopnetwork.io/bud-node-standalone.zip
3. Use one of the trusted nodes hosted by TheCoopNetwork.io (no installation needed for this option): https://node1.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node2.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node3.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node4.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node5.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://server.thecoopnetwork.io/

As zero trust is required to run this blockchain, we recommend using option 1 whenever possible.

### Option 1: get code compile and run it ###
  - *dependencies*:
		- to compile you need Java 11 or newer JDK on Linux
			- *Ubuntu*/*Debian* - sudo apt install default-jdk
  - ./compile.sh --skip-desktop
  - ./run.sh
  - Open in your browser http://localhost:6876/

### Option 2: download compiled node  ###
  - *dependencies*:
  - to run you need Java 11 or newer JRE on Windows or Linux (java binary must be in PATH)
  - Download zip file from https://bud.thecoopnetwork.io/bud-node-standalone.zip or https://blockchain.thecoopnetwork.io/bud-node-standalone.zip
  - Extract contains and run start.bat on Windows or start.sh on Linux.
  - Open in your browser http://localhost:6876/
  - Check the version you are using http://localhost:6876/version
	
### Option 3: use trusted node  ###
   - open in your browser one of the nodes https://node1.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node2.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node3.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node4.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://node5.thecoopnetwork.io/ https://server.thecoopnetwork.io/

Please make sure you never use your private passphrase on any site unless you trust the node (e.g. is running on your own machine).
In case you use remote (over the internet node) please make sure https is enabled and certificate is valid.

# Welcome to GMD! #


----
## What is GMD? ##
Geoma DAO (GMD) is a cryptocurrency to make the world a better place.


----
## How to use it? ##
One of the following options must be chosen in order to use it (more details about each option on next paragraph):
1. Download the code from this repository, compile it on Linux and run it on Windows or Linux
2. Download the compiled node and run it on your Windows or Linux PC. 
3. Use one of the trusted nodes hosted by TheCoopNetwork.io (no installation needed for this option)



As zero trust is required to run this blockchain, we recommend using option 1 whenever possible.


----
### Option 1: get code compile and run it ###
  - *dependencies*:
		- to compile you need Java 11 or newer JDK on Linux
			- *Ubuntu*/*Debian* - sudo apt install default-jdk
  - ./compile.sh --skip-desktop
  - ./run.sh
  - Open in your browser http://localhost:6876/

### Option 2: download compiled node  ###
  - *dependencies*:
  - to run you need Java 11 or newer JRE on Windows or Linux (java binary must be in PATH)
  - Download zip file from either of the following:
      - https://node10.thecoopnetwork.io/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv6 and IPv4)
      - https://node8.thecoopnetwork.io/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv4 only)
      - https://node6.thecoopnetwork.io/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv4 only)
      - https://node12.thecoopnetwork.io/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv4 only)
      - https://awss3bucket-gmd.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv4 only)
      - https://node13.thecoopnetwork.io/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv6 only)
      - https://node16.thecoopnetwork.io/gmd-node-standalone.zip (IPv6 only)
  - Extract contains and run start.bat on Windows or start.sh on Linux.
  - Open in your browser http://localhost:6876/
  - [Optional] Version can be checked http://localhost:6876/version
	
### Option 3: use trusted node  ###
   - open in your browser one of the nodes
 - IPv6 and IPv4:
   - https://node10.thecoopnetwork.io
 - IPv4 Only:
   - https://node1.thecoopnetwork.io 
   - https://node2.thecoopnetwork.io 
   - https://node3.thecoopnetwork.io 
   - https://node4.thecoopnetwork.io 
   - https://node5.thecoopnetwork.io 
   - https://node6.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node7.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node8.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node11.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node12.thecoopnetwork.io
- IPv6 only:
   - https://node9.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node13.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node14.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node15.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node16.thecoopnetwork.io
   - https://node17.thecoopnetwork.io
   
   
Please make sure you never use your private passphrase on any site unless you trust the node (e.g. is running on your own machine).
In case you use remote (over the internet node) please make sure https is enabled and certificate is valid.


Nodes are tested and run well over both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
